# Too Much Wind For Basketball

I am alone, I am playing basketball for my self, and it is very windy

## Intro 

This game is originally produced for the [Berlin Mini Jam](http://berlinminijam.de/) of 2021-01-23, where we have less than 8 hours to prototype and deliver your game.

## Themes

These were the proposed themes for the jam: 

- pure chaos
- totally unrealistic sports game
- only 2 colors

I think into the idea I am introducing "pure chaos" and "totally unrealistic game"

## Inspiration

For this creation I want to put a lot of attention on art, I would like to do something very cute with water color style.

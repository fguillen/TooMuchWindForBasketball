# Too Much Wind For Basketball

It is a game, but it also a story, a story about me, or maybe about you.

It is about this person, she is alone, but is not receiving this as a something negative, she is enjoying herself, she is playing basketball by herself. She is having fun, making some baskets...

At some point the wind starts getting stronger but this person is determined to make some good baskets today so she persists. The wind keeps growing but our protagonist remains imperturbable doing her best and using the wind dance as part of the game.

How long can we hold out?
How strong the wind can become?

... Find out for your self. Look for "Too Much Wind for Basketball" at itch.io



## Intro

This game is originally produced for the [Berlin Mini Jam](http://berlinminijam.de/) of 2021-01-23, where we have less than 8 hours to prototype and deliver your game.

## Themes

These were the proposed themes for the jam:

- pure chaos
- totally unrealistic sports game
- only 2 colors

I think into the idea I am introducing "pure chaos" and "totally unrealistic game"

## Inspiration

For this creation I want to put a lot of attention on art, I would like to do something very cute with water color style.

Water colors from Kristina del Ba√±o:
